NSS Node.JS Exercises: Chinook DB - ERD (01)

## Instructions
1. Hit the link above to download and unzip the file.
1. Open up DB Broswer for SQLite again, click 'open database', and select from the Chinook Database labeled `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite`.  
1. Be a good, honest, upstanding citizen and don't click the link on the Chinook home page to view the data model or search Google images for "Chinook database". Do your best to glean the relationships from the tables and make a complete ERD before peeking to see if you've hit the mark.

To view the ERD, please see the PDF in the repository.
